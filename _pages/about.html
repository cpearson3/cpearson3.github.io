<h1>About me</h1>
<p>I am a web and database application developer with 5+ years of professional experience
based in Morgantown, WV, USA. I have worked with numerous clients, from small businesses to state universities, to <b>design, develop, and support</b> many types of applications.
I always <b>prioritize communication</b> with the users and clients to establish a clear set of requirements. I'm strongly focused on delivering <b>maintainable code</b> and I pay attention to details.
</p>
<p>
    The type of work I've done includes: Building database queries and stored procedures in <b>PL SQL</b>;
    developing reports with <b>Oracle Reports, Excel, and the web</b>; creating user interfaces for desktop database users with
    <b>Oracle Forms Builder</b> and for mobile web users using <b>Angular, jQuery, Bootstrap and custom CSS frameworks</b>;
    building <b>Python and Shell scripts</b> for system jobs and development tools; and managing projects with <b>Git</b>.

<h3>Projects</h3>
<p>I like to stay busy outside of work with side projects and learning exercises.
Web development is an industry which demands a commitment to continuing education. Some projects include:</p>
